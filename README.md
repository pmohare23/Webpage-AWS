# Webpage-AWS

Created homepage using a simple HTML file (e.g., index.html) and an error page (e.g., error.html). The error page could be used to render a message to the users if the
main page is not available for any reason. This is deployed on AWS Simple Storage Service (AWS S3).

Created a Dynamic Web Project using Student Survey form (HTML) and an external cascading stylesheet (CSS).
Deployed on local Tomcat instance, prior to deploying the war file on the Tomcat server running on Amazon EC2 instance in AWS cloud.
